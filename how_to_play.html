		<h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1><br>
		
		<h2>BlackJack</h2>
		<p>
			In BlackJack the aim is to get cards as close to the value of 21 without going over. 
			At the start of each round, you may place a bet. After which you may choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (stop drawing cards). 
			You can draw as many cards as you like until the combined value of your cards reaches 21. 
			If you go over 21, you automatically lose, unless the dealer also goes over in which case it ends a draw. 
			If both you and the dealer have less than 21, but the same number, the game also ends in a draw.
			You can win the round in two ways. The first is to reach exactly 21, whilst the dealer fails to do so, whether they go over or remain under. 
			The other way to win, is to get closer to 21 than the dealer, while still not going over. 
			<br>
			Most cards value is equal to the number on the card. So, for example, the 2 of clubs, will add 2 to the total, or the 8 of diamonds will add 8.
			However, there are exceptions to this, as not all playing cards, have numbers on them. Jacks, Queens and Kings (J, Q and K respectively) all add 10 to the total. 
			The other card to note are the aces (A). These cards initillay count for 11, however, if you were to draw another card, which would take your total over 21, then the ace
			changes value to 1. Meaning you may be able to take additional risks if you have an ace in your hand.
		<p>
		
		<h2>Higher or Lower?</h2>
		<p>
			In this game, the aim is to get the longest streak of correct guesses possible. The game will start with one hidden card, and one unhidden card. You will then guess if the unhidden cards value is
			higher, or lower than the hidden cards value. If you get it correct, your streak will increase by one. 
			To continue the game, you can then press the "Next Card" button. this will then show a new card, which once again you will have to guess if its higher or lower than the new hidden card. 
			This game also requires taking risks. You may have a low number relative to the rest, however, it could still be higher than the hidden card. So, although there may be a higher likelihood it is lower, it is never guarenteed.
			<br>
			In this game, all number cards have a value equal to their respective number. However, the Aces, Jacks, Queens and Kings are slightly different. Aces (A), are always equal to 1 in this game. 
			Jacks (J), are worth 11, Queens (Q), are worth 12, and Kinga (K), are worth 13. this means the range of numbers is 1 - 13
